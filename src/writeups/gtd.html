    <p>For this app, you begin by listing an item or task. This will list it in an inbox.
        This item can be then categorized as actionable, something that can be done and not a vague goal. In the next tab, the item shows up.
        It then can be categorized further into either a project, which involves multiple steps, a next action which is an action that
        can be done immediately, or an appointment, in which you can pick a date. You can also delete, toggle, and edit items which is from an earlier
         project, the todolist.
    </p>
    <p>This app involes a number of libraries. Bootstrap and jquery for tabbed content.
        bootstrap date picker library to make appointments. This project utilizes webpack to allow for imported
        modules.
    </p>
    <p>Concerning the code, a class is utilized as each item will have many boolean properties 
        concerning which category each item is in as well as id and date properties. Ids are generated at random when the list item object
        is instantiated. There are also methods involving manipulating storage as this app uses localstorage for persistance.
        A wrapper for event listeners was implemented due to many different inputs with different DOMstrings and the DOMevents. 
        An init function is used to set up query selectors, event listeners, and populate the display. 
    </p>
    <p>
        With this project, I learned more about the blur and change events and how to implement node module libraries with a build tool.
        I also did a lot of reading of the documentation to correctly implement the date picker library.
