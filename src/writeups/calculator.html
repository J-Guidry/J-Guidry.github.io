    <p>With the calculator, I first started with implementing a console version of it.
        Using an object literal, 5 methods were made and four properties. Two methods for assigning a number and the next number. 
        One method for assigning the operator. One method for performing the operation and a last one for clearing the data. 
        The first two properties held the number and the next number. The third for the operator. The last one for the result of the calculation.
    </p>
    <p>When it came to implementing the rest with the UI,there were two object literals created. 
            One of them concerned the UI with display and outputing the result as well as clearing the display. 
            This uses the textContent property drilling down using the read only children property to access the display to either clear or populate it.
            The other one has event listeners and called methods from the first object literal containing the data and operations and sends data to the UI methods.
            Using an if else chain, chain operations were implemented. A switch statement is used to support keyboard inputs and not just button clicks.</p>
    <p>
        When implementing CSS, CSS grid was used in setting up the rows and columns for the calculator's buttons. A responsive container is used to resize the
        calculator as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        To implement operations, an if else chain is used which checks the operator and both number properties. Once the operation is done, the result is assigned to a property which is used
        by the UI in the other object literals. Frustrations included trying to get chain operations to work and making sure the display worked correctly.
