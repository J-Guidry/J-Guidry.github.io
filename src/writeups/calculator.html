        <p>With the calculator, I first started with implementing a console version of it.
            Using an object literal, 5 methods were made and four properties. Two methods for assigning a number and the next number. 
            One method for assigning the operator. One method for performing the operation and a last one for clearing the data. 
            The first two properties held the number and the next number. The third for the operator. The last one for the result of the calculation.
        </p>
        <p>When it came to implementing the rest with the UI,there were two object literals created. 
                One of them concerned the UI with display and outputing the result as well as clearing the display. 
                This uses the textContent property drilling down using the read only children property to access the display to either clear or populate it.
                The other one has event listeners and called methods from the first object literal containing the data and operations and sends data to the UI methods.
                Using an if else chain, chain operations were implemented. A switch statement is used to support keyboard inputs and not just button clicks.</p>
        <p>
            When implementing CSS, CSS grid was used in setting up the rows and columns for the calculator's buttons. A responsive container is used to resize the
            calculator as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            To implement operations, an if else chain is used which checks the operator and both number properties. Once the operation is done, the result is assigned to a property which is used
            by the UI in the other object literals. Frustrations included trying to get chain operations to work and making sure the display worked correctly. 

        </p>
            <p>Here is the logic that is done which a click happens:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>
                <li>Check the class of what was clicked.</li>
                <li>If a number was clicked or typed, run the select number method.</li>
                <li>Whether it was clicked or typed, display the number on screen.</li>
                <li>Depending on which numbers/operator were set, parse the int from string to integer, and then set them. </li>
                <li>If the first has been set, it will set the next number.</li>
                <li>Once the user clicks a operator, it will make a check for the number properties using the chain operations method.</li>
                <li>Depending on conditions, for example, the normal condition of the first number being set, it will display, then set the operator.</li>
                <li>Other conditions involve which number properties are filled and whether the the result property is filled</li>
                <li>Once both numbers and an operator is set, clicking or typing the equals, will trigger the calculate function which will perform an operation which is dispalyed.</li>
                <li>If the escape key or the C button is clicked, all the properties will be cleared.</li>
            </li>
        </ol>
