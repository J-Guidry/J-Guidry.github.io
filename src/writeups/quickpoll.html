    <p>
        Inspired by strawpoll.me, it lets you create polls, vote on them and share them.
        This does not use authentication as it is not a serious poll site. There is also a search function.
    </p>
    <p>
        The quickpoll is the first full stack app I did on my own. At first, I did most of it with regular PHP,
        but later switched to Laravel to better understand how MVC frameworks operate and the kind of measures they use 
        for security and validation. Using PostgreSQL as the database, I designed database tables for the polls, and poll options.
        I made use of seed and migrattion files as well as the chart.js library on the frontend. I set up routes, controllers, and an env file.
        I learned of csrf tokens and did validation and sanitization of incoming data. 
        I also learned the blade template engine. 
    </p>
    <p>I had problems trying to get AJAX to work with either the axios library or with the Fetch API. 
        In the end, I used jquery's ajax implementation. It also took me quite some time to learn the particulars of the chart.js library.
        There was much documentation to read through for each aspect of the app. Designing database tables, using Eloquent ORM, properly importing and using chart.js, etc.
